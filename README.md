# my-ubuntu-configuration
Run this script after installing Ubuntu on my computer.

Contents for this script:
- [ ] Change repository address for downloading and updating software
- [x] Update up-to-date packages installed on Ubuntu 
- [x] Establishing essential environment to develop software (e.g. gcc, gdb)
- [x] Environment for developing software with Java
- [x] Environment for developing software with Python (With pyenv, pip)
- [x] Environment for developing software with Node.js (With nvm)
- [ ] Environment for developing software with Go
- [ ] Database: PostgresSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- [x] Downloading and installing editors (e.g. vim, Visual Studio Code)

After executing this script, I have to install IntelliJ & PyCharm from JetBrains manually.
(Because I have a professional license of PyCharm and I'll probably buy all products pack in next year.)
